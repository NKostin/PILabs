she came to him.
she entered very carefully, moving silently, floating through the chamber like a phantom; the only sound was that of her mantle brushing her naked skin.
he moved, but with pressure from both hands, she forbade him to change position and, with a light but decisive movement of her hips, demanded a response.
he responded. she no longer backed away from his hands; she threw her head back, shook her hair. her skin was cool and surprisingly smooth. her eyes, glimpsed when her face came close to his,
were huge and dark as the eyes of a water nymph.
rocked, he sank into a sea of chamomile as it grew agitated and seethed.
later, it was said the man came from the north, from ropers gate. he came on foot, leading his laden horse by the bridle.
it was late afternoon and the ropers, saddlers and tanners stalls were already closed, the street empty. it was hot but the man had a black coat thrown over his shoulders. 
he drew attention to himself.
he stopped in front of the old narakort inn, stood there for a moment, listened to the hubbub of voices. as usual, at this hour, it was full of people.
the stranger did not enter the old narakort. he pulled his horse further down the street to another tavern, a smaller one, called the fox. not enjoying the best of reputations, it was almost empty.
the innkeeper raised his head above a barrel of pickled cucumbers and measured the man with his gaze. the outsider, still in his coat, stood stiffly in front of the counter, motionless and silent.
what will it be?
beer, said the stranger. his voice was unpleasant.
the innkeeper wiped his hands on his canvas apron and filled a chipped earthenware tankard.
